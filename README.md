<small><b>A simple module for handling async requests synchronously <br> throughout your application</b></small>
</pre>

## üß≠ Overview

Waiter is a simple module for handling async requests synchronously throughout your front-end applications.

It allows micro-frontends to handle async requests synchronously, simplifying application flow and data exchange between
components.

## üöÄ Features

- **Synchronous requests**: Handles async requests synchronously, simplifying application flow and data exchange between
  components.
- **Controller-based**: Organizes requests using controllers for better manageability.
- **Promise-based API**: Facilitates async programming with promises.
- **Lightweight**: Is a lightweight library with no dependencies, making it easy to integrate into your project.
- **TypeScript Support**: Is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions out of the box.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### NPM

```bash
npm i @strange-bytes/waiter
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @strange-bytes/waiter
```

### PNPM

```bash
pnpm add @strange-bytes/waiter
```

## üß© Usage

To use Waiter, you need to import it into your project:

```typescript
// ES6
import Waiter from 'waiter';
// CommonJS
const Waiter = require('waiter');
```

Then you can create a new instance of Waiter to add controllers and handle requests:

```typescript
// App A
const waiter = new Waiter();

waiter.createController('fetchUserState', () => {
  const { user } = userStore();
  return user;
});
```

```typescript
// App B
const waiter = new Waiter();

const user = await waiter.request('fetchUserState');
```

## üìñ API

### `constructor(options)`

Creates an instance of Waiter. You can optionally specify a custom namespace and output prefix.

- **options**: Object with optional properties:
    - **namespace**: The namespace to use for the Waiter configuration. Defaults to `__WAITER_CONFIG_COMMON__`.
    - **outputPrefix**: The prefix to use for output messages. Defaults to '[Waiter]'.

### `createController(endpoint, callback)`

Registers a new controller that handles requests to a specific endpoint.

- **endpoint**: string - The name of the endpoint.
- **callback**: Function - The function to execute when the endpoint is called. It should return the response.

### `removeController(endpointName)`

Removes a previously registered controller.

- **endpointName**: string - The name of the endpoint to remove.

### `request(endpointName, payload, options)`

Sends a request to a specific endpoint and returns a promise that resolves with the response.

- **endpointName**: string - The name of the endpoint to send the request to.
- **payload**: any - The payload to send with the request.
- **options**: Object with optional properties:
    - **timeout**: number - Optional timeout in milliseconds. Defaults to 1000ms.

### `config`

Provides access to the current Waiter configuration. This is a read-only property.
